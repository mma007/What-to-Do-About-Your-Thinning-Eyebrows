Eyebrow hair loss is a very real problem. It is often caused by the things you did to your eyebrows when you were younger. Shaping the eyebrows has always been popular. Plucking them or waxing the eyebrows causes the hair to eventually quit growing back. The ending result is either very little eyebrow hair or none.

What Causes Eyebrow Hair Loss?

This can be seen in older women, who have been plucking or waxing their eyebrows all their life. Constantly plucking the eyebrows damages the hair follicles. After a certain period of time, the eyebrows just do not come back. This can result in a problem for women who are particularly vigilant about doing this when they are younger.

The eyebrow hair loss can be minimized by only occasionally plucking. Leave most of them natural and only go after stray hairs here and here. In some cases, it is too late and you are already experiencing the loss of eyebrow hair from too many years of waxing or plucking. When this happens, there are few alternatives.

Using an Eyebrow Pencil

The eyebrows can be penciled in if you do it lightly. The natural color should be used and they should not be heavily drawn. The overdoing of eyebrows will end up looking garish.

This is one of the mistakes women make when using an eyebrow pencil. If you consider why you were plucking or waxing your eyebrows in the first place, does it make sense to draw them back heavily? They should be very lightly penciled in to match any remaining eyebrow hair.

Following the natural line of the eyebrows is another aspect when you fill in the eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil. Too high on the brow line makes you look as if you are in a perpetual questioning mode. Too low will make you look like you are really having a bad day.

Sometimes eyebrow hair loss is due to certain hair loss problems. There are some problems that cause hair loss over the whole body. If this is the reason for your hair loss, it may only be temporary. However, the fact remains that you have to have eyebrows right now. So the only solution is to use an eyebrow pencil to draw in your eyebrows.

Options

There are of course, options for the loss of eyebrow hair. Transplants are one of the solutions. This is an expensive procedure. The transplant can start at $4000 and go on up to $20,000 or more.

Another option is an eyebrow replacement. These are eyebrows made of actual hair that are placed on the brow line with an adhesive. They are natural looking and are a solution for those who do not want to draw their eyebrows on or have them tattooed.

Regardless of why you have eyebrow hair loss, there are solutions. The one you choose will be the best one for you. If you decide on eyebrow replacement, there are very good choices to match them to your hair color. If transplants are your choice, just be aware of the expense related to this procedure. If you just want to use an eyebrow pencil, remember to make them look natural.
